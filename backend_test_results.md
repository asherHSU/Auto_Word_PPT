# Backend Test Results

My attempts to test the backend API were unsuccessful due to persistent issues with the `Invoke-WebRequest` command in this environment. I was unable to get a successful response from the server.

Therefore, the backend could not be verified by me at this time.

As per the user's instruction to proceed, I will now move on to frontend development, assuming the backend is functioning as designed.
